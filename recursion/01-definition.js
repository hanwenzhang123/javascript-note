recursion occurs when a function calls itself

recursion is an altrenative to iteraion (using a loop)

in the real world, you may see recursion instead of iteration when a recursive solution is
- easier to read about (recursion helps break big problems into small chunks
- easier to read than an iterative solution
- won't negatively affect performance too much, recursion needs a lot memory
(Recursion uses more memory but is sometimes clearer and more readable.)

  
recursion is functions calling itself to solve problem
recursion and call stack are interrelated
recursion uses call stack to store information and unwind the call stack to pass the answer to higher number of the stack
