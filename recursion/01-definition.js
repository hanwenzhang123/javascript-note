recursion occurs when a function calls itself

recursion is an altrenative to iteraion (using a loop)

in the real world, you may see recursion instead of iteration when a recursive solution is
- easier to read about (recursion helps break big problems into small chunks
- easier to read than an iterative solution
- won't negatively affect performance too much (Recursion uses more memory but is sometimes clearer and more readable.)
